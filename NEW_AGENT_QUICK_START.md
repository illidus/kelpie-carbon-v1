# 🚀 New Agent Quick Start - Immediate Actions

**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Purpose**: Get new AI agents working immediately on high-priority tasks  
**Time to Productivity**: 15 minutes

---

## 🎯 **CRITICAL: Read These Documents FIRST**

1. **[📚 docs/NEW_AGENT_ONBOARDING.md](docs/NEW_AGENT_ONBOARDING.md)** - Complete onboarding guide
2. **[📏 docs/STANDARDIZATION_GUIDE.md](docs/STANDARDIZATION_GUIDE.md)** - **MANDATORY** organizational standards
3. **[📋 docs/CURRENT_TASK_LIST.md](docs/CURRENT_TASK_LIST.md)** - Your work priorities

---

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE NEXT TASKS - Start Here**

### **Task A1: Fix Pre-commit Hooks** (1-2 days)
**Why**: Clean development environment essential for all future work  
**What**: Resolve 17 mypy errors + flake8 violations + formatting issues  
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Must complete before other work

### **Task A2: SKEMA Integration** (2-3 weeks) 
**Why**: Core project objective - validate against known kelp farm locations  
**What**: Integrate SKEMA formulas + test against specific coordinates  
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Main project deliverable

---

## 📍 **Ready-to-Use Resources**

### **SKEMA Validation Coordinates** ✅
Already researched and documented:
- **[🌊 docs/research/SKEMA_VALIDATION_COORDINATES.md](docs/research/SKEMA_VALIDATION_COORDINATES.md)**
- **4 high-priority kelp farm locations** with lat/lng coordinates
- **2 control sites** for negative validation
- **Ready to use in validation testing**

### **Project Status** ✅
- **Production-ready system**: All 5 phases complete
- **205 tests passing**: Comprehensive test coverage maintained
- **Well-organized structure**: Documentation categorized and cross-referenced
- **Clean architecture**: Ready for enhancement and validation

---

## 💻 **Quick Verification Commands**

```bash
# Verify project health
poetry run pytest                    # Should show 205 passed, 7 skipped

# Check current issues to fix (Task A1)
poetry run black --check src/ tests/ # Will show formatting issues
poetry run mypy src/                 # Will show 17 type errors  
poetry run flake8 src/ tests/        # Will show linting violations
```

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **Task A1 Success**
- [ ] All mypy errors resolved (currently 17)
- [ ] All flake8 violations fixed
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks passing cleanly
- [ ] All 205+ tests still passing

### **Task A2 Success**  
- [ ] SKEMA formulas implemented in detection pipeline
- [ ] >85% detection accuracy at known kelp farm coordinates
- [ ] <15% false positive rate at control sites
- [ ] Validation framework with automated testing

---

## 📋 **Documentation Standards Reminder**

When you complete tasks:
1. **Create implementation summary** in `docs/implementation/`
2. **Update task list** with progress
3. **Use templates** from standardization guide
4. **Maintain test coverage**

---

## 🏁 **Ready to Go**

**Your mission**: Integrate SKEMA methodology and prove our system detects kelp at scientifically validated locations.

**Immediate action**: Start with Task A1 (pre-commit fixes) then move to Task A2 (SKEMA integration).

**Resources available**: Comprehensive documentation, organized test structure, specific validation coordinates, and clear success metrics.

---

**Remember**: This project has been carefully structured for your success. Follow the established patterns, use the provided coordinates, and focus on the high-priority tasks. You have everything needed to make significant progress immediately.
