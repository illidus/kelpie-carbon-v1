## Objective
Validate our budget deep learning implementations against real satellite imagery and research benchmarks.

## Validation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Testing (Current)
- Test existing implementations with synthetic data
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Download SAM model for full testing

### Phase 2: Real Data Acquisition
- Acquire Sentinel-2 imagery from known kelp sites
- Prepare ground truth validation data
- Set up preprocessing pipeline

### Phase 3: Performance Benchmarking  
- Test all three implementations on real data
- Compare against research benchmarks
- Analyze cost-performance trade-offs

### Phase 4: Production Assessment
- Evaluate scalability and reliability
- Create deployment recommendations
- Document findings and next steps

## Research Benchmarks
- Enhanced U-Net: AUC-PR 0.2739 (38% improvement over ResNet)
- Vision Transformers: 85% accuracy (competition performance)
- Traditional CNN: 70% accuracy (baseline)
- Our targets: 75-90% accuracy with 97% cost savings

## Next Steps
1. Run existing test suite: `poetry run python scripts/test_budget_deep_learning_suite.py`
2. Download SAM model for full testing
3. Acquire real satellite imagery for validation
4. Compare performance against research benchmarks
