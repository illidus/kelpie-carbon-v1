## 🔧 Quick Start

### **Installation**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kelpie-carbon-v1.git
cd kelpie-carbon-v1

# Install dependencies with Poetry (recommended)
pip install poetry
poetry install

# Or install with pip
pip install -e .

# Run system verification
poetry run pytest tests/ -x  # Stop on first failure
```

### **Basic Usage**

```python
from kelpie_carbon.core import AnalyticsFramework
from kelpie_carbon.reporting import StakeholderReports

# Initialize analytics framework
analytics = AnalyticsFramework()

# Run comprehensive analysis
results = analytics.run_comprehensive_analysis(
    dataset_path="data/sample_kelp_data.nc",
    analysis_types=['validation', 'temporal', 'species']
)

# Generate stakeholder reports
reporter = StakeholderReports()
reports = reporter.generate_all_reports(results, region="Broughton_Archipelago")
```

### **Demo & Validation**

```bash
# Run core functionality tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Check system health
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_api.py -v
```
