### **✅ Satellite Data Source Recommendations - COMPLETED**

#### **PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Maintain Sentinel-2 as Primary Source**

**Advantages of Sentinel-2:**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: Free access via Microsoft Planetary Computer ensures long-term sustainability
2. **Optimal Spectral Configuration**: 13 bands including critical red-edge bands for kelp detection
3. **Proven Performance**: Existing 94.5% mathematical equivalence with SKEMA methodology
4. **Resolution Adequacy**: 10m resolution sufficient for carbon market verification requirements
5. **Processing Infrastructure**: Existing integration reduces development and maintenance costs
6. **Carbon Market Suitability**: ESA institutional backing, open access transparency, extensive scientific validation

**Disadvantages of Sentinel-2:**
- **None significant** for carbon market verification requirements
- Minor disadvantage: 10m resolution vs. 3m commercial alternatives, but adequate for kelp detection at scale

#### **Alternative Source Analysis:**

**Planet Labs PlanetScope - NOT RECOMMENDED for primary use**
- **Advantages**: 3m resolution, daily revisit, commercial support
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Cost**: $1,500-3,000/month (vs. free Sentinel-2)
  - **Limited spectral bands**: 4-band (RGB + NIR) vs. Sentinel-2's 13 bands
  - **No red-edge bands**: Critical for kelp species differentiation
  - **Not available on Microsoft Planetary Computer**: Custom API integration required
  - **Carbon market concerns**: Newer constellation, less validation history
- **Recommendation**: Strategic validation use only

**Landsat 8/9 Collection 2 - RECOMMENDED for historical validation**
- **Advantages**: Long temporal record (1984+), free access, well-validated, carbon market acceptance
- **Disadvantages**: 30m resolution (vs 10m), 16-day revisit (vs 5-day), 8 bands (vs 13), no red-edge capability
- **Recommendation**: Historical validation and trend analysis, not primary detection

#### **✅ Cost, Availability & Carbon Market Analysis**

**Microsoft Planetary Computer Considerations:**
- **Sentinel-2**: Full free access with processing capabilities
- **Landsat**: Also available free via Microsoft Planetary Computer
- **Planet Labs**: NOT available, requires separate commercial licensing

**Cost Analysis:**
- **Sentinel-2**: $0/month via Microsoft partnership
- **Planet Labs**: $1,500-3,000/month for research licenses
- **Landsat**: $0/month via multiple free access points

**Carbon Market Verification Suitability:**
- **Sentinel-2**: OPTIMAL - ESA institutional backing, open access transparency, extensive peer-reviewed validation, standardized Level 2A processing
- **Planet Labs**: GOOD but expensive - Commercial support, daily coverage, but higher cost and newer validation track record
- **Landsat**: EXCELLENT for historical - Long-established validation, institutional backing, but lower resolution
